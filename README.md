this is an app that will fectch gifs of whatever game is searched.
simply type the name of a game in the search bar and 25 random results will load to the page.
created using html, css, and javascript with jquery.
in the future the site could be improved by polishing the look of the ui.
also more functionality could be added to be more specific about the content to be returned.
finally the returned gifs could be more organized upon being returned.
